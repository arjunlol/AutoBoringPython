Just learned how github works :) 
It's very confusing, but hopefully I'll get used to it.

This week marks the journey of starting to learn to code starting with Python. I'm currently working full time which bites 50-60 hours 
of learning time. I'll code during any pockets of free time I have. This repo is the start from the very basics reading through
Automate the Boring Stuff with Python. Started on September 20, 2016 - so far learned basic Python syntax, loops, lists, 
and the basics of git.
